Prerequisites:
You need to extract-
Fallout - Sound.bsa
Fallout - Textures.bsa
Fallout - Textures2.bsa
Fallout - Voices1.bsa
It is recommended to use: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/974/
Extract these to "Fallout New Vegas\Data\" - It will auto create texture and sound folders here

You will need python to run the progam
If you do not know how to run a python program:
go to where the file is located and double click
if this does not work go to command prompt and navigate to the directory of the file
then do "python filename.py" - I recommend googling how to do this if you get stuck as windows command prompt can be challenging


How to use:
Place the python files in your data directory

Firsly run the 'Remove.py' This removes all normal maps
Once completed it will say "Press Enter To Close"

Then you can run "Randomiser.py"
This can randomise all Sound and Texture files
You can choose once you have entered your directory to randomise just Textures, Sound or both
Once finished it will say "Press Enter To Close"
